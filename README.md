# testtechy

## Basic Overview
Testtechy is a test suite of the starter codebase of a fully functioning Tech Quiz application. It enhances the code by adding Cypress for both component and end-to-end tests. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It allows users to take a quiz of ten random questions and view their final score.

To following was done to complete the testing:

    Install Cypress as a dev dependency.

    Configure Cypress for both component and end-to-end testing.

    Create a component test for the quiz component.

    Create an end-to-test for the quiz component.
